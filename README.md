# Movie-Recommender
This project is a content-based movie recommender system developed using Python. When a user inputs a movie name, the system suggests similar movies based on movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew. The application uses Streamlit for the user interface, and the model is serialized using pickle.
