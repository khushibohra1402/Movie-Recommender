# Movie-Recommender

Introduction
This project is a content-based movie recommender system developed using Python. When a user inputs a movie name, the system suggests similar movies based on movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew. The application uses Streamlit for the user interface, and the model is serialized using pickle.


Features
->Suggests similar movies based on a given movie name
->Utilizes content-based filtering techniques
->Interactive user interface using Streamlit
->Model serialized with pickle for easy loading and inference

Technologies Used
->Python
->Pandas
->NumPy
->Scikit-learn
->Streamlit
->Pickle
->Requests

Dataset
The recommender system uses a movie dataset containing metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew. This project utilizes the TMDB from kaggle.
